			<p>This is a simple, single page architectured, synchronized to-do list built with AngularJS I built as a learning project.</p>

			<ul>I wanted to be able to:
				<li>see completed or expired items</li>
				<li>select and view categories</li>
				<li>have tasks expire after a week</li>
				<li>use it from my phone or tablet</li>
				<li>change the theme and color</li>
			</ul>


<p>I used a remote database so it would be accessible anywhere and made it responsive so I could use it on my phone.</p>

<p>I learned a lot making it. It was daunting at the time. Now itâ€™s a reminder that small and simple can be useful and elegant. </p>
		

			<ul class="imgList">To-Do has:
				<li class="listRow">
					<img class="imgLeft" src="/images/bb-long-500.png">	<p class="imgCaption">A page that has all the information on every bike in a sortable list. From color to VIN.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="imgCaption">Two abbreviated lists with only essential data, one for ready bikes, one for offline bikes.</p><img class="imgRight" src="/images/bb-short-500.png">
				</li>
				<li class="listRow">
					<img class="imgLeft" src="/images/bb-new-500.png"><p class="imgCaption">A validated form for entering all pertinent data on a new machine.</p>

				<li>
					<p class="imgCaption">A maintenance log that can be called up by selecting any bike on any list.</p><img class="imgRight" src="/images/bb-log-500.png"></li>
				<li class="listRow">
					<img class="imgLeft" src="/images/bb-stats-500.png"><p class="imgCaption">A quick overview of bike readiness, year and type.</p>
